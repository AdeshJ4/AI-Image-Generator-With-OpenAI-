1. OpenAI Node.js Library
-------------------------

The OpenAI Node.js library provides convenient access to the OpenAI API from Node.js applications. 
Most of the code in this library is generated from our OpenAPI specification.

Important note: this library is meant for server-side usage only, as using it in client-side browser code 
                will expose your secret API key. See here for more details.

The library needs to be configured with your account's secret key, which is available on the website. 
We recommend setting it as an environment variable.
